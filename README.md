# Testing :

This is a HTML CSS and JS web site, my main consaern in the project was the logic apllyed to the quiz.

 - The project was built with a desktop approach, Because it was easier for me to create the content in the page.

 - It was hard to fix the Js bugs in all HTML pages. But in the end no relevants errors nor bugs.
