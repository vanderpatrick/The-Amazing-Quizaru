# The Amazing Quizaru :

### The Amazing Quizaru was developed by me as my second Full Stack Web Development project with Code Institute.

# Reason :
The Amazing Quizaro was developed to give more information about the skate universe in an funny and interactively way. By playing this quiz you gonna learn some useful information about some skate legends and also some hidden rules to make your skateboarding experience much better.

# The user Experience (UX)

##  Audience : 

- People who want to learn more about skating.
- Skaters that want to test their knowledge about skate facts.
- skaters who wish to spend some time in a fast and funny game.

## User Report : 

- first experience

    1. As a user I would like instructions to know how to play.
    2. As a user I would like an easy way to navigate the website.
    3. As a user I would like to immediately play the game.

- Second experience

    1. I would want to re-test my knowledge.
    2. I would want all answers correct.
    3. I would want to know who made the game.

- As a developer    
    
    1. I want to make it interactive.
    2. I want the site to have an direct image of what you can do. 
    3. I want to give a good time with interesting questions about the skate universe that you probably didn't knew.


# Features :

The Features were designed to distinguish each area with ease so the user can explore the site instinctively.

# Testing :

This is an HTML CSS and JS website, my main concern in the project was the logic applied to the quiz.

 - The project was built with a desktop approach Because it was easier for me to create the content on the page.

 - It was hard to fix the Js bugs in all HTML pages. But in the end it passed all tests.

 # Test Validators :

## Here you have access to all HTML validators from all 5 pages:
