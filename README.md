# The Amazing Quizaru :

### The Amazing Quizaru was developed by me as my second Full Stack Web Development project with Code Institute.

# Reason :
The Amazing Quizaro was developed with the porpuse of giving more information about the skate universe in a funny and interactive way. By playing this quiz you gonna learn some usefull information about some skate legends and also some hidden rules to make your skateboarding experience much better.

# The user Experience (UX)

    1. As a user I would like instructions to know how to play.
    2. As a user I would like easy way to navigate in the website.
    3. As a user I would like to imidiatly play the game.

- Second experience

    1. I would want to re-test my knowladge.

    2. I want to make the site have a direct image about what you can do. 
    3. I want to give a good time with interessting questions about the skate universe that you probaly dont know.

# Testing :

This is a HTML CSS and JS web site, my main consaern in the project was the logic apllyed to the quiz.

 - The project was built with a desktop approach, Because it was easier for me to create the content in the page.

 - It was hard to fix the Js bugs in all HTML pages. But in the end no relevants errors nor bugs.
